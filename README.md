# Face-Recognition
In this model, we leverage the power of both OpenCV and TensorFlow to construct a highly accurate face recognition system. OpenCV provides comprehensive tools for image processing, including face detection, alignment, and preprocessing, while TensorFlow serves as the backbone for training and deploying the Siamese neural network.
